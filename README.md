Label My Stuff
========

## Description
 
 A universal app published to the App Store in order to help users keep inventory by generating, printing and scanning QR codes.
 
 Remarkably enough it is still backward compatible all the way back to iOS 6!
 
 Uses Core Data.
 
 CocoaPods:
* Google AdMob 
* ZXingObjC
* ZBarSDK
* BCGenieEffect
* ECSlidingViewController (Modified version updated to keep backward compatibility and fix a screen rotation issue on the iPad).

All graphics I prepared myself using Gimp and Inkscape.
